🚀 Launching: Passive Income Skill Stack for OpenClaw

I built 5 skills that automate the most time-consuming parts of running a freelance business:

• Content repurposing
• SEO content creation  
• Lead qualification
• Proposal generation
• Invoice tracking

Thread 🧵

1/ The Problem

Freelancers spend 40% of their time on:
• Writing proposals that don't close
• Following up on unpaid invoices
• Creating content that gets 3 likes
• Qualifying leads who can't afford them

That's billable time down the drain.

---

2/ The Solution

I created 5 OpenClaw skills that handle the busywork:

✅ Content Repurposer — 1 blog post → 10 social posts
✅ SEO Content Engine — keyword research → ranking content
✅ Client Intake Bot — qualify leads while you sleep
✅ Proposal Generator — brief → professional proposal
✅ Invoice Tracker — automated billing & reminders

---

3/ How It Works

Install the skills. Ask OpenClaw what you need.

"Create a proposal for this client brief"
→ Professional proposal with pricing tiers

"Repurpose this blog post for Twitter"
→ 7-tweet thread ready to post

"Invoice Acme Corp for $5,000"
→ Professional invoice + payment tracking

---

4/ Pricing

Individual skills: $25-40 each
Bundles: $49-79
Complete stack (all 5): $119 (save $41)

One-time purchase. Lifetime updates.

---

5/ Free Skills Too

Not ready to buy? I made 3 free skills:
• Simple proposal template
• Invoice template  
• Content ideas generator

Try before you buy. Link in bio.

---

6/ The Real Value

These skills don't just save time.

They help you:
• Close more deals (better proposals)
• Get paid faster (automated reminders)
• Attract better clients (qualification)
• Build authority (consistent content)

---

7/ Who This Is For

• Freelancers drowning in admin
• Consultants who hate sales
• Agency owners scaling up
• Anyone who values their time

If you bill $100+/hour, this pays for itself in one saved hour.

I just launched something I'm really proud of.

For the past month, I've been building a complete business automation suite for OpenClaw — 5 skills that handle the most time-consuming parts of running a freelance business.

Here's what I built:

🔄 Content Repurposer
Turn one blog post into Twitter threads, LinkedIn posts, newsletters, and social snippets. Stop writing from scratch every time.

🔍 SEO Content Engine  
Go from keyword research to ranking content. Includes SERP analysis, outline generation, and on-page SEO guidance.

🤖 Client Intake Bot
Qualify leads automatically. Score them hot/warm/cold. Route the best opportunities to your inbox instantly.

📝 Proposal Generator
Transform client briefs into professional proposals with executive summaries, pricing tiers, and terms.

💰 Invoice Tracker
Generate invoices, track payments, send automated reminders, and reconcile your books.

The skills work individually, but they're designed to work together:

Content → attracts leads → intake bot qualifies → proposal generator closes → invoice tracker gets you paid.

Pricing:
• Individual skills: $25-40
• Bundles: $49-79  
• Complete stack: $119 (save $41)

I also created 3 free skills for anyone who wants to try before buying.

If you're a freelancer, consultant, or agency owner who values their time, this is for you.

**Show IH: I built 5 OpenClaw skills to automate my freelance business**

Hey IH,

I've been freelancing for 3 years, and I was drowning in admin work. Proposals, invoices, content, lead qualification — it was eating 40% of my time.

So I built 5 OpenClaw skills to automate it all.

**What I Built**

1. **Content Repurposer** — 1 blog post → 10 social posts
2. **SEO Content Engine** — keyword research → ranking content
3. **Client Intake Bot** — qualify leads while you sleep

**How It Works**

OpenClaw is an AI agent platform. These skills are like plugins that give it specialized knowledge.

You install them, then ask OpenClaw things like:

"Create a proposal for this client brief" → Get a complete proposal with pricing tiers

"Repurpose this blog post for LinkedIn" → Get a formatted post

"Invoice Acme Corp for $5,000" → Get a professional invoice + tracking

---

**The Business Model**

- 3 free skills (lead magnets)
- 5 premium skills ($25-40 each)
- 2 bundles ($49-79)

**Questions for IH**

1. Would you use something like this?
2. What's the best way to reach freelancers?
3. Should I offer a subscription model instead of one-time?

Would love your feedback!

Subject: New skills to automate your freelance business

Hey [Name],

Quick question: How much time do you spend each week on:

• Writing proposals?
• Following up on invoices?
• Creating content?
• Qualifying leads?

If you're like most freelancers, it's 10-15 hours. That's $1,000-2,000 of billable time.

I built something to fix that.

I built some tools to automate the worst parts of freelancing

Hey r/freelance,

I've been freelancing for 3 years, and I got tired of:

• Writing proposals that took 2+ hours each
• Following up on invoices (awkward)
• Creating content that got 3 likes
• Talking to leads who couldn't afford me

So I built 5 automation tools for OpenClaw (an AI agent platform) that handle:

✅ Content repurposing — 1 blog post → 10 social posts
✅ SEO content creation — keyword research → ranking article  
✅ Lead qualification — bot asks questions, scores leads, routes hot ones to me
✅ Proposal generation — brief → professional proposal with pricing tiers
✅ Invoice tracking — automated reminders so I don't have to chase payments

**Results so far:**

• Proposals now take 10 minutes instead of 2 hours
• Invoices get paid faster (automated reminders work)
• I only talk to qualified leads
• Content actually gets engagement

**Pricing:**

Individual tools: $25-40
Bundles: $49-79
All 5 tools: $119

I also made 3 free versions if you want to try before buying.

**Links:**

GitHub: github.com/kambrosgroup/passive-income-skills

Would love feedback from fellow freelancers. What part of your business would you automate if you could?

*Note: These are OpenClaw skills, so you need OpenClaw installed to use them. Think of them like plugins that teach the AI specific workflows.*
